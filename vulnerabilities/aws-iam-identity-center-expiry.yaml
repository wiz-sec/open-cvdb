summary: |
  AWS IAM Identity Center exchanges third-party OIDC tokens for
  Identity Center-issued tokens. Identity Center relies on the jti
  claim in the third-party tokens to prevent replay attacks. 
  Identity Center maintained a cache of previously-seen jti values
  for a fixed period (24 hours) and didnâ€™t enforce that the third-party
  tokens had expiry claims. This meant that a token with a jti claim and
  without an exp claim could be replayed after >24 hours had passed.
