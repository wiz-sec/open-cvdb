summary: |
  Tenable Research discovered a privilege escalation flaw that allows a user to escalate privileges to that 
  of the root user within the context of a Spark VM. They also discovered a separate flaw that allows a user to poison 
  the hosts file on all nodes in their Spark pool, which would allow an attacker to redirect subsets of traffic and snoop on 
  services users generally do not have access to.
