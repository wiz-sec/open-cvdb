summary: |
  Legit Security found a zero-click vulnerability in Azure Pipelines that allows
  an attacker to access secrets and internal information and perform actions in
  elevated permissions in the context of a pipeline workflow. This could allow 
  attackers to move laterally in the organization and initiate supply chain attacks.
  When a pipeline is triggered by a "pipeline resource trigger," it shows in the
  platform as "Automatically Triggered For …" Instead of running in fork default
  permissions, preventing any access to secrets and sensitive actions, Azure Pipelines
  "confuses" the trigger for an internal build allowing access sensitive build secrets.
  Exploitability depends on a public GitHub repository that runs Azure pipelines on pull-request,
  with default Azure pipeline fork configurations to trigger pipeline run, and Pipeline-Triggers.
manualRemediation: |
  None required if you are using Azure DevOps cloud services. 
  Otherwise, make sure you're running a patched build.
