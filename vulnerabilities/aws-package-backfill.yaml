summary: |
  Two malicious versions were created of packages previously used by AWS.
  The packages were officially authored and maintained by AWS before they
  were removed by their legitimate author, and once the packages were
  removed, their names became available and the two packages were then
  populated with malicious code. If AWS-deployed software had any dependencies
  on these packages, this would have led to a dependency confusion attack.
