summary: |
  On April 28 and April 30, respectively, Mend Diffend identified, blocked,
  and reported two packages they deemed were malicious versions of original Amazon
  Web Services (AWS) packages. The two packages above were officially authored by
  AWS before they were removed by a legitimate author, and once the packages were
  removed, their names became available and the two packages were then populated
  with malicious code.
