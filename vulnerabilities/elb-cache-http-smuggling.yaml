summary: |
  While testing rate-limiter protection, The reseacher noticed that when forcing HTTP/1 requests and injecting 
  a space after `X-Forwarded-For` he was able to override this specific header, letting him impersonate any IP.
  Any internal header could have beem overriden, also the one that should not be exposed/forwarded by the
  client, such as `CloudFront-Viewer-Country-Region` or any other `CloudFront` enhanced header. 
  This special security issue was affecting all AWS users with that a specific setting enabled.
