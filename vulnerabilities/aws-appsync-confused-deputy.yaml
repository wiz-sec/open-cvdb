summary: |
  The AWS AppSync service could be coerced to assume arbitrary roles in
  other customers' accounts which trusted the AppSync service. This was
  due to insufficient validation of a serviceRoleArn parameter (caused by
  a case-sensitivity parsing issue). With this vulnerability, if an adversary
  knew the ARN of the role associated with AppSync in the target account,
  they could use it invoke arbitrary AWS API calls.
manualRemediation: |
  None required

  Suspicious calls from roles assumed by the AppSync service.
