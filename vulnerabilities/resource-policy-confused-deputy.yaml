summary: |
  Resource policies lacked a way of restricting service access to only your
  own account, allowing an attacker to leverage a service to potentially access
  your resources. Originally discovered by Dan Peebles and presented at re:Invent
  in 2018, this issue did not gain enough attention to be fixed until Shir Tamari
  and Ami Luttwak from Wiz presented it at Black Hat 2021.
manualRemediation: |
  Update existing vulnerable IAM policies by adding scoping condition.
