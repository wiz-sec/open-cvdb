summary: |
    Azure iPaaS services, such as Logic Apps, separate the Control Plane (management) from the Data Plane (execution), but a flaw in this model enabled undetectable data harvesting.
    An attacker with Azure Reader access to workflow run history can silently extract sensitive data from executions, including secrets and API responses. This is possible because execution details are exposed via the Control Plane, bypassing Data Plane access controls.
    The root cause of this issue is the unintended exposure of runtime data through metadata endpoints, which could allow an attacker to passively collect information without triggering alerts or requiring direct execution privileges.
manualRemediation: |
  Reduce scope and usage of the Reader role. Assign it via PIM for JIT rather than standing Access. Consider creation of custom roles instead of Reader.
detectionMethods: Undetectable, as the required logs are not available to Azure customers (as confirmed by Microsoft).
