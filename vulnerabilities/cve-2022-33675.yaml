summary: |
  The Microsoft Azure Site Recovery suite contained a DLL hijacking flaw that allowed for
  privilege escalation from any low privileged user to SYSTEM on hosts where this service was installed.
  Incorrect permissions on the cxprocessserver service's executable directory allowed new files to be
  created in it by any user. Since the service ran automatically and with SYSTEM privileges and attempted
  to load DLLs from the directory, this allowed for a DLL hijacking / planting attack.
