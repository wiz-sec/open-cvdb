summary: |
  A BGP-based feature of the AWS Direct Connect service allowed a third party to inject an incorrect route for an external IP, effectively hijacking AWS-sourced traffic. This resulted in connectivity issues between AWS EC2 instances and external systems. The issue was caused by a typo in a Direct Connect customer's configuration, which advertised an incorrect prefix to AWS.
manualRemediation: |
  None required. AWS has improved their process for validating IP prefix ownership for Direct Connect public virtual interfaces.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected routing or connectivity issues between AWS EC2 instances and external IP addresses. Use tools like mtr or traceroute to identify abnormal network paths.
