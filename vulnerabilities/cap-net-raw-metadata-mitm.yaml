summary: |
  An attacker with access to a hostNetwork=true container with CAP_NET_RAW
  capability can listen to all the traffic going through the host and inject arbitrary
  traffic, allowing to tamper with most unencrypted traffic (HTTP, DNS, DHCP, ...),
  and disrupt encrypted traffic. In GKE the host queries the metadata service at
  http://169[.]254.169.254 to get information, including the authorized SSH keys.
  By manipulating the metadata service responses and injecting our own SSH key, it
  is possible to gain root privilege on the host.
