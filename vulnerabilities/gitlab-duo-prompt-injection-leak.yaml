summary: |
  A remote prompt injection vulnerability in GitLab Duo allowed attackers to steal source code from private projects, manipulate code suggestions, and exfiltrate confidential information. The attack chain involved hidden prompts, HTML injection, and exploitation of Duo's access to private data. GitLab has since patched both the HTML and prompt injection vectors.
manualRemediation: |
  None required. GitLab has patched the vulnerability.
