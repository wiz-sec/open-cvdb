summary: |
  AWS identified a security issue in the AWS CDK CLI versions 2.172.0-2.178.1 where temporary credentials from custom credential plugins could be printed to console output. This potentially exposes sensitive information to users with access to the console. The issue affects plugins that include an expiration property when returning temporary credentials.
manualRemediation: |
  Upgrade to AWS CDK CLI version 2.178.2 or later. Revoke temporary credentials, limit console access, and rotate long-lived IAM user credentials if affected.
detectionMethods: |
  Scan logs of CDK CLI executions after December 6, 2024 for statements containing accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, and sessionToken. Look for output similar to: { accessKeyId: '<secret>', secretAccessKey: '<secret>', sessionToken: '<secret>', expiration: <date>, '$source': <object> }
