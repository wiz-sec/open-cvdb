summary: |
  AWS identified an issue in the Amazon WorkSpaces Windows client which resulted in unintentionally logging
  connection debugging information to a user's local system. This data could include usernames or passwords
  if they contain specific characters: \ (backslash) or " (double quotes). If an attacker gained access to
  an Amazon WorkSpaces user's machine, they could then compromise such credentials from the log.
manualRemediation: |
  Update the client to version 5.11.0 or higher. New versions of the client will automatically delete local logs generated by vulnerable versions.
