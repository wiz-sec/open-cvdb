summary: |
  The API action ListVpcConnectorsForAccount did not properly validate the "AccountId" parameter
  that was passed to it. As a result, any account ID could be provided and the API would return
  the information for that account. This would leak minor information about the VPC 
  configuration for App Runner in the account including the subnet ID, security group ID, and the
  VPC Connector ARN.
