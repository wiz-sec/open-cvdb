summary: |
  Orca discovered vulnerabilities in Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry
  that could have enabled an attacker to achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by
  using iframe postMessages. The vulnerabilities allowed embedding of endpoints
  within remote attacker-controlled servers using the iframe tag, thereby granting
  unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s session in the affected service if they
  were tricked into navigating to an attacker-controlled website. The root cause
  was that certain web pages in the Bastion and Container Registry customer-facing
  portals allowed embedding of iframes in remote servers, meaning they were not
  using mitigations such as the X-Frame-Options header or the frame-ancestors
  directive in a Content Security Policy (CSP), which would have prevented these issues.
