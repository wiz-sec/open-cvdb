summary: |
  SafeBreach Labs researchers developed methods to leverage Microsoft Azure's Automation Service for free, undetectable cryptocurrency mining. They found three ways to execute miners: two using their own environment and Azure's resources for free, and one in a victim's environment undetected. The techniques could potentially be used for any task requiring code execution on Azure.
