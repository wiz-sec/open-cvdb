summary: |
  Shortly after Lake Formation was made generally available, a bug was discovered
  that gave anyone the ability to view and override data lake admins for any account
  (an attacker would have only needed to know the target account number in advance).
  The root cause was in the Catalog ID, which references the Glue metadata store that
  Lake Formation uses to store its configuration - none of the methods that used this
  field actually checked for permissions on the account it was accessing, only the
  source account. Moreover, CloudTrail was only writing the log to the source account,
  so anyone auditing the destination account would not have been able to observe any
  suspicious activity. Following disclosure, AWS fixed the bug.
