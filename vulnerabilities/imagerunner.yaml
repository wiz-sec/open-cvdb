summary: |
   An attacker with `run.services.update` and `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permissions but without
   explicit registry access could deploy new revisions of Cloud Run services that pulled private
   container images stored in the same GCP project. This was possible because Cloud Run uses a
   service agent with the necessary registry read permissions to retrieve these images, regardless
   of the caller’s access level. By updating a service revision and injecting malicious commands
   into the container's arguments (e.g., using Netcat for reverse shell access), attackers could
   extract secrets or run unauthorized code. The flaw stemmed from the Cloud Run service agent’s
   trust model, which did not enforce a separate registry permission check on the deploying identity.
   Google has since modified this behavior to require that the identity updating the Cloud Run
   resource also has explicit Artifact Registry Reader or Storage Object Viewer roles.
