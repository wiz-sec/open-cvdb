summary: |
  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) uses IAM to provide authentication to the cluster through the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes (aws-iam-authenticator).
  aws-iam-authenticator can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, and it is installed by default in any EKS cluster both on AWS cloud and on-premises (Amazon EKS Anywhere).
  A security issue was discovered in aws-iam-authenticator where an allow-listed IAM identity may be able to modify their username and escalate privileges.
  The bug allowed an attacker to (1) craft a malicious token with any action value, (2) without signing the cluster ID, (3) that would manipulate the AccessKeyID value.
  Essentially, in clusters using aws-iam-authenticator, if an {{AccessKeyID}} was mapped to an IAM user with cluster admin privileges, any non-privileged user could have escalated their privileges to cluster admin.
manualRemediation: |
  EKS instances have been auto-updated. For self-hosted installations, upgrading aws-iam-authenticator to v0.5.9 fixes this vulnerability.
  As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by not using the {{AccessKeyID}} template value to construct usernames. 
detectionMethods: |
  None - this issue affected the logged identity, and is not discernible from valid requests.
