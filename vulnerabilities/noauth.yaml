summary: |
  Descope identified a possible misconfiguration in Azure AD which could lead to misuse of the "Log in with Microsoft"
  authentication method on a web app. If an application relies on email attribute claims for authentication (which is
  against best practice) and also merges user accounts without proper validation, an attacker could falsify an email
  claim to gain full control over the target account. Descope and Microsoft Microsoft identified several popular multi-tenant
  applications with users that used an email address with an unverified domain owner, which would therefore be vulnerable
  to this type of takeover. Following  disclosure, Microsoft deployed mitigations to omit token claims from unverified
  domain owners for most applications.
