summary: |
  An SSRF bug in GCP's Stackdriver Debugger feature's code import could have been used to leak the authentication
  token of the user to an attacker-controlled server. Exploitation would require that the user had previously
  configured a specific code hosting service (such as GitHub), and could be tricked into clicking a malicious link.
