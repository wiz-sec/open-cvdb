summary: |
  When the compute API is enabled on a GCP Project, the default compute account
  is created. This account gets the primitive role Editor assigned by default, which
  allows for a wide variety of privilege excalation and resource abuse in the project.
  Especially, all new VMs created inherit this permissions by default. This issue
  is arguably a technical decision by GCP, but the documents advise customers to
  undo this.
manualRemediation: |
  Remove these permissions, it can be done via an organization policy
