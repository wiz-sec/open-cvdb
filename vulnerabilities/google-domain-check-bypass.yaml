summary: |
  A vulnerability in Google's common JavaScript library allowed bypassing domain validation checks across multiple Google products. By using a backslash character in URLs, an attacker could make the regex parser and browser disagree on the authority (domain) portion of a URL, allowing injection of arbitrary domains that pass whitelisting checks.
manualRemediation: |
  None required
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected URL parsing behaviors, especially URLs containing backslash characters between the authority and path components.
