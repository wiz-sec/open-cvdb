summary: |
  A vulnerability in Power Platform could lead to unauthorized access to Custom
  Code functions used for custom connectors, thereby allowing cross-tenant information
  disclosure of secrets or other sensitive information if these were embedded in a
  Custom Code function. The issue occurred as a result of insufficient access control
  to Azure Function hosts, which are launched as part of the creation and operation of
  custom connectors in Microsoft’s Power Platform. An attacker who determined the
  hostname of the Azure Function associated with the custom connector could interact
  with the function without authentication. Microsoft fixed the issue by requiring Azure
  Function keys for accessing the Function hosts and their HTTP trigger. An initial fix
  was deployed (on June 7th, 2023), but customers using affected Custom Code in a "soft
  deleted state" (part of a data recovery mechanism) remained vulnerable until a later
  fix was applied (on August 2nd, 2023).
