summary: |
  AWS's Account Assessment for AWS Organizations tool, designed to audit cross-account access, inadvertently introduced privilege escalation risks due to flawed deployment instructions. Customers were encouraged to deploy the tool in lower-sensitivity accounts, creating risky trust paths from insecure environments into highly sensitive ones. This could allow attackers to pivot from compromised development accounts into production and management accounts.
manualRemediation: |
  Uninstall the tool by deleting CloudFormation stacks for Hub, Spoke, and Org-Management components. If needed, redeploy with the hub role in an account with security equivalent to the management account to prevent privilege escalation risks.
detectionMethods: |
  Search for IAM roles containing "ScanSpokeResource" or "AccountAssessment-Spoke-ExecutionRole" in their names. Use AWS CLI command: aws iam list-roles --query "Roles[?contains(RoleName, 'ScanSpokeResource') || contains(RoleName, 'AccountAssessment-Spoke-ExecutionRole')]"
