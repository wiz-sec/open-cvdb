summary: |
  When making authenticated API requests to AWS, the requests must be signed
  with your AWS access key. The initial signing algorithm, SigV1, was vulnerable
  to collisions. A person-in-the-middle attack would be able to modify signed requests
  via specially constructed collisions.
manualRemediation: |
  None required, SigV1 is deprecated at this point
