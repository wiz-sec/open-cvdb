summary: |
  A vulnerability in the Amazon ECS agent could allow an introspection server to be accessed off-host.
  This information disclosure issue, if exploited, could allow another instance in the same security
  group to access the server's data. The vulnerability does not affect instances where off-host access
  is set to 'false'. The issue has been patched in version 1.97.1 of the ECS agent.
manualRemediation: |
  Users can update the Amazon ECS agent to version 1.97.1 or later. If updating is not an option,
  customers can restrict incoming access to the introspection server port (51678) by modifying
  their Amazon EC2 security groups.
detectionMethods: |
  To detect if you are running a vulnerable version, check if your ECS agent is version 1.97.0 or earlier.
  You should also check for any anomalous network activity targeting the introspection server port (51678) in your security group.
