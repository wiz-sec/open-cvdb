summary: |
  A bug in Entra ID restricted management administrative units allowed creating immutable users that couldn't be modified or disabled, even by Global Administrators. This could enable an attacker to protect a compromised account from containment. The issue was caused by a timing vulnerability when removing users from restricted AUs and required specific steps to remediate affected accounts.
manualRemediation: |
  Add affected user to a new restricted management AU, then delete that AU without first removing the user. Wait 5-10 minutes for restricted status to clear.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for creation of restricted management AUs and users being added to them. Datadog Cloud SIEM provides detections for these activities.
