summary: |
  Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Google Cloud SQL, including config file injection leading to RCE, information disclosure in the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, and a design issue in Postgres IAM authentication allowing access token theft. Other issues included GCR permission misconfigurations and potential for terminal escape sequence injection attacks via gcloud.

  Upgrade Cloud SQL Auth Proxy clients to force TLSv1.3. Review and restrict permissions on GCR repositories. Consider disabling MySQL LOAD DATA LOCAL feature.
