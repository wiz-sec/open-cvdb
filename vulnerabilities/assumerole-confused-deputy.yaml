summary: |
  3rd party vendors can (and sometimes do) incorrectly implement sts:ExternalId in their
  AWS role trust policies, leading to confused deputy issues. These misconfigurations could
  allow customers to access other customers' data. Although vendors are responsible for
  ensuring their own configurations are correct, AWS could theoretically add mitigations
  to prevent and detect this issue.
manualRemediation: |
  Audit your vendor roles.
