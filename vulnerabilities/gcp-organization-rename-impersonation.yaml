summary: |
  A GCP Organizations name could be changed through the (deprecated) organizations.update 
  method in the Resource Manager, even though the documentation said the "displayName" was read-only.
  With this, I could have my own organization and name it as another one and confuse users:
  - Rename an organization "<IMPORTANT-COMPANY>.com"
  - Share it with "domain:<IMPORTANT-COMPANY>.com" (Effectively sharing it with every 
  Google user with a @<IMPORTANT-COMPANY>.com account)
  - Profit from unsuspecting users creating resources in my organization, specially billing 
  accounts or building projects that manage sensible information.
