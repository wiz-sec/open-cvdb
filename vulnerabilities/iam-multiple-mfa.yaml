summary: |
  An AWS-recommended IAM policy that enforced MFA on access keys could have been bypassed
  due to a change implemented by AWS in November 2022 that allowed IAM users to assign
  multiple MFA devices to their account. Prior to this change, an attacker that had compromised
  credentials could not create and assign a new MFA device to bypass the MFA requirement as they
  would need to first deactivate the userâ€™s existing MFA device. Organisations using SSO which
  enforces MFA, either via an external IdP or AWS SSO, were not affected by this issue.
