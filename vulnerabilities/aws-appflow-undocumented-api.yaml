summary: |
  AppFlow had an undocumented service called sandstoneconfigurationservicelambda. 
  An undocumented field (awsOwnedManagedAppCredentialsArn) could be used during
  connector registration and connector updates. Specifying a victim's Secret ARN
  as that field disclosed the clientId and clientSecret, so long as the victim
  Secret ARN belonged to a connection profile which is of the type 
  OAuth or contains clientId and clientSecret.
