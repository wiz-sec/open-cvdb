summary: |
  Azure Arc allows customers to connect on-premises Kubernetes clusters to Azure.
  This is facilitated by middleware (the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes agent) which
  includes a "cluster connect" feature in the form of a reverse proxy. A vulnerability
  in this feature could allow an unauthenticated user to elevate their privileges
  and potentially gain remote administrative control over any Azure Arc-enabled
  cluster, as long as they know its randomly generated external DNS endpoint.
  Azure Stack Edge devices are also affected, because the service supports
  deployment of Kubernetes workloads via Azure Arc.
manualRemediation: |
  For Azure Arc customers using auto-upgrade (which is enabled by default),
  no action is required. Otherwise, the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes agent
  must be updated to versions 1.5.8, 1.6.19, 1.7.18 or 1.8.11 (see link to
  instructions in references). Azure Stack Edge customers must update to
  the 2209 release (software version 2.2.2088.5593).
