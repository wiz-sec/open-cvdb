summary: |
  Google Cloudshell leveraged websockets without validating that the origin matched the current instance host.
  An attacker could therefore host a CSWSH attack on a Cloudshell instance they own, disabling authentication via 
  access to the underlying VM. They could then start the OAuth process with a spoofed host header, using
  phishing to get the target Cloud Shell user into following a redirection link, completing the OAuth process
  and ending in successful CSWSH, which would allow the attacker to hijack the target user's requests.
