summary: |
  The API action ListObservabilityConfigurationsForAccount did not properly validate the 
  "AccountId" parameter that was passed to it. As a result, any account ID could be provided 
  and the API would return the information for that account. This would leak minor information
  about the observability configuration for App Runner in the account.
