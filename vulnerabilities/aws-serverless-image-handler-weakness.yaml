summary: |
  AWS solution 'Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront', prior to version 6.2.6, contains a configuration weakness. The Lambda role doesn't constrain bucket access, and the environment variable can be set to a wildcard, allowing access to any bucket. This could potentially lead to unintended access to sensitive images across multiple buckets in the AWS account.
manualRemediation: |
  Upgrade to version 6.2.6 or later of the AWS Serverless Image Handler. Ensure that the SOURCE_BUCKET variable is set to specific bucket names and not wildcards. Review and restrict IAM policies for Lambda functions to access only necessary S3 buckets.
detectionMethods: |
  Check the version of AWS Serverless Image Handler in use. Review Lambda function configurations, particularly the SOURCE_BUCKET environment variable and IAM roles. Audit S3 bucket access logs for unexpected access patterns from Lambda functions associated with this service.
