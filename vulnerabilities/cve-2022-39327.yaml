summary: |
  Azure CLI contained a code injection vulnerability that could be exploited in
  a scenario where the host runs a command where parameter values have been provided
  by an external untrusted source - these could be specially crafted in such a way
  as to exploit the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution on the host.
  The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows
  machine and with any version of PowerShell and when the parameter value contains
  the `&` or `|` symbols.
manualRemediation: |
  Upgrade to Azure CLI 2.40.0 or greater.
