summary: |
  The AWS CodeStar service had an undocumented API (codestar:CreateProjectFromTemplate) that allowed
  users with broadly-scoped CodeStar permissions to create a CodeStar project. As part of the creation
  process, AWS would create a new CodeStarWorker IAM policy & attach it to the user making the call.
  This policy granted full access to over 50 AWS services, including iam:AttachRolePolicy, iam:AttachUserPolicy and iam:PutRolePolicy permissions,
  which would allow the user to escalate to full administrator access. Following disclosure, AWS removed
  the majority of access granted by the CodeStarWorker policy, but this is still a viable escalation path if
  there are other misconfigurations in the environment.
manualRemediation: |
  If not using the CodeStar service, ensure that the “aws-codestar-service-role” is removed from all your accounts. 
  Apply principle of least privilege to all CodeStar-related resources to ensure the codestar:CreateProjectFromTemplate 
  permission is only granted when absolutely necessary. Implement monitoring on any users with access to the 
  codestar:CreateProject and iam:PassRole actions to detect potential escalation attempts.
