summary: |
  ApsaraDB and AnalyticDB contained several vulnerabilities in their PostgreSQL offerings
  which ultimately allowed unauthorized access to other tenants' databases and the ability
  to perform a supply-chain attack on both services, which in turn would have allowed remote
  code execution (RCE) as well. Both services implemented multi-tenancy through a shared K8s
  cluster, but contained several bugs related to tenant isolation which an attacker could
  chain together to achieve the above impact. In ApsaraDB, these included privilege escalation
  to root in a container, a shared PID namespace enabling container escape, and write permissions
  granted to K8s nodes for a private container image registry utilized by both services.
  In AnalyticDB, the bugs included file disclosure, command line injection in a privileged
  container, and susceptibility to the core_pattern container escape technique.
