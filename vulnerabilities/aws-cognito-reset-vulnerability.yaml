summary: |
  A vulnerability in AWS Cognito's password reset function allowed attackers to brute-force the six-digit reset code, potentially leading to account takeovers. Using concurrent HTTP requests, an attacker could make up to 1587 guesses instead of the documented limit of 20. The issue affected accounts without multi-factor authentication and was fixed by AWS on April 20, 2021.
manualRemediation: |
  Enable multi-factor authentication for AWS Cognito accounts. AWS customers can implement their own rate-limiting before sending requests to AWS Cognito.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unusual patterns of password reset attempts on AWS Cognito accounts, particularly those involving a high number of failed attempts in a short period.
