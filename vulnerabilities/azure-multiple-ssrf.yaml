summary: |
  SSRF vulnerabilities were discovered in four Azure services: unauthenticated SSRF in
  Azure Digital Twins Explorer and Azure Functions, and authenticated SSRF in Azure API
  Management Service and Azure Machine Learning Service. All four vulnerabilities were
  full (non-blind) SSRF. The impact of these vulnerabilities was limited: while they
  would have allowed an adversary to scan local ports and find new services, endpoints,
  and files; they would not have allowed them to access metadata, connect to internal
  services, access unauthorized data, or obtain cross-tenant access.
