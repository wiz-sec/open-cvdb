summary: |
  Upon blocking a request, GCP Org policy constraints were logging the deny
  logs in Principal''s project and the blocking project. An attacker could use those
  logs to exfiltrate any data, by making request from a Principal they own from
  a defender project.
manualRemediation: | 
  Review denied logs in the defender project, because it was also logged there.
