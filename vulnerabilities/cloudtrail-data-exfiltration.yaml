summary: |
  This scenario describes a potential data exfiltration technique using AWS CloudTrail. An attacker with access to CloudTrail logs could potentially extract sensitive information from logged events, including API calls and data modifications. This poses a risk to data confidentiality and could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
manualRemediation: |
  Implement strict access controls for CloudTrail logs, use encryption, and regularly audit access to CloudTrail data. Consider using AWS CloudTrail Lake for centralized storage and analysis of logs.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor CloudTrail access logs for unusual patterns or high-volume data transfers. Implement alerting for suspicious API calls or frequent access to CloudTrail data from unexpected sources.
