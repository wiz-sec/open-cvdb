summary: |
  A vulnerability discovered in GCP's Cloud SQL service allowed customer
  administrator accounts to create triggers in the tempdb database and use
  those to gain sysadmin privileges in the instance. This could be abused
  to result in complete control of the database engine and access to the
  host OS. An attacker could have listed and accessed files in the host OS,
  including any secrets on the machine, as well as gaining access to service
  agents. However, it is unclear from the report if this level of access could
  have allowed lateral movement within the Cloud SQL service or grant cross-tenant
  access to other customers' data. The reporters did not disclose any lateral movement
  and Google stated in their security bulletin that it was not possible.
