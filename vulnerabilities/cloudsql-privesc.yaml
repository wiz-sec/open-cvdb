summary: |
  A vulnerability in GCP's Cloud SQL for SQL Server service allowed customer
  administrator accounts to create triggers in the tempdb database and use
  those to gain sysadmin privileges in the instance. This access gives complete
  control of the database engine and access to the host OS. An attacker could have
  listed and accessed files in the host OS, including any secrets on the machine,
  as well as gaining access to service agents. The reporters did not disclose any
  lateral movement and Google stated in their security bulletin it was not possible.
