summary: |
  Researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Google Cloud SQL that allowed gaining unauthorized shell access to MySQL instances. By chaining SQL injection, parameter injection in mysqldump, and network spoofing, they were able to escape a Docker container and gain full access to the host VM running Cloud SQL.

  None required. Google patched the vulnerabilities.
