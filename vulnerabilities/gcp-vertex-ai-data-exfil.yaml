summary: |
  In Vertex AI Studio, a Prompt Injection attack could cause the LLM to return
  markdown tags. This could have allowed an adversary whose data makes it into
  the chat context (e.g., via an uploaded file) to achieve
  exfiltration of the victim’s data by rendering hyperlinks. However, the severity of this issue is low,
  as there were no integrations that could pull remote content. This means
  Indirect Prompt Injection was not possible, and it would require the victim to copy
  the malicious prompt from elsewhere. A similar issue affected Azure AI.
