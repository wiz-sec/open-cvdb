summary: |
  The AWS Amplify service was found to be misconfiguring IAM roles associated 
  with Amplify projects. This misconfiguration caused these roles to be assumable 
  by any other AWS account. Both the Amplify Studio and the Amplify CLI 
  exhibited this behavior. Any Amplify project created using the Amplify CLI
  built between July 3, 2018 and August 8, 2019 had IAM roles that were assumable by
  anyone in the world. AWS mitigated this vulnerability through backend changes to
  STS and IAM, and also released a patch for the Amplify CLI to ensure that newly
  created roles are properly configured in accordance with these changes.
manualRemediation: |
  None required, but customers should upgrade to Amplify CLI 12.10.1 or higher to
  ensure that newly created roles are compatible with the backend mitigations.
detectionMethods: |
  Review CloudTrail logs for suspicious sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API calls in which 
  the identity pool ID is not owned by an identity pool in the same account.
