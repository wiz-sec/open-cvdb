summary: |
  If a malicious actor with prior access to an AWS environment has permission to modify the S3
  Replication Service role access policy, they could abuse cross-account replication to exfiltrate
  stolen data to an external bucket under their control. Moreover, when configured to replicate
  to multiple buckets at once, and if logging is only scoped to specific buckets (as opposed to
  being set to log "all current and future buckets"), then the S3 Replication Service only logs a putObject event to CloudTrail
  for the first destination bucket. Thus, as long as the malicious actor's bucket isn't the first
  replication destination, their activity wouldn't be logged in CloudTrail, and might go undetected.

  Monitor for changes to Replication rules (e.g., via the S3BucketChangesAlarm alert in CloudWatch) and note any suspicious destinations.
