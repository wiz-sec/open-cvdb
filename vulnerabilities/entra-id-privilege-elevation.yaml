summary: |
  Semperis researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications that allowed privilege elevation in Entra ID beyond expected authorization controls. The most severe finding enabled adding users to privileged roles, including Global Administrator, without proper permissions. The issues affected Device Registration Service, Viva Engage, and Microsoft Rights Management Service. Microsoft has since resolved the vulnerabilities.
