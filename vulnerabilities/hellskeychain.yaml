summary: |
  IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL was vulnerable to an attack sequence
  comprised of PostgreSQL privilege escalation via SQL Injection and chaining
  of three secrets scattered in the service environment (a K8s service account
  token, a private container registry password, and CI/CD server credentials),
  which were abusable due to overly permissive network access to internal build
  servers. A malicious actor could have exploited this vulnerability to remotely
  execute code in other customersâ€™ environments in order to read and modify data
  stored in their PostgreSQL databases.
