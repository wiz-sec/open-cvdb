summary: |
  The @actions/core package had a delimiter injection vulnerability in the exportVariable function. Attackers could use a known delimiter to break out of a specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. This may have allowed modification of path or environment variables without the intention of workflow or action authors.
manualRemediation: |
  Upgrade to @actions/core v1.9.1 or ensure user input does not contain the delimiter '_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_' before calling core.exportVariable.
detectionMethods: |
  Review workflows and actions that write untrusted values to the GITHUB_ENV file. Check for potential manipulation of path or other environment variables.
