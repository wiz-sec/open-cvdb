summary: |
  Composer, Dataflow, Dataproc, Dataprep and Data Fusion all used the Compute Engine
  default service account by default and relied on product-level IAM permissions
  without requiring the iam.serviceAccount.actAs permission, meaning that users of
  these services could elevate their privileges. Following disclosure, GCP changed
  these services to require this permission.
