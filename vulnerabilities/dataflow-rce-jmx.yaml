summary: |
  Dataflow worker nodes ran an unauthenticated Java Management Extensions (JMX) service that under
  certain circumstances would be exposed to the Internet, thus allowing unauthenticated remote code
  execution (RCE) as root in an unprivileged container. The impact of the vulnerability depended on
  which service account qA assigned to Dataflow worker nodes (by default, that would be the Google
  Compute Engine default service account, which has the project-wide Editor role assigned).
