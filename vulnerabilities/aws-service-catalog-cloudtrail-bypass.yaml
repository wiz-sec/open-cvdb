summary: |
  Due to an exposed development endpoint, it was possible to bypass CloudTrail
  logging for both read and write API actions for the Service Catalog service.
  This could have enabled adversaries to alter Service Catalog resources undetected
  after gaining a foothold in a victim AWS environment.
