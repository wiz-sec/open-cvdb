summary: |
  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) uses IAM to provide authentication to the cluster
  through the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes (aws-iam-authenticator). Multiple issues
  were identified in the authenticator that could have allowed exploitation, namely (1) a
  lax regular expression used to verify presigned URLs; (2) HTTP client redirect follow
  (due to using Golang HTTP client in its default configuration); (3) use of the Golang URL.Query
  function (which silently drops parameters that Go considers invalid, rather than raising
  an error and rejecting invalid tokens); and (4) no verification that the cluster uses Go
  versions newer than 1.12 (as older versions are vulnerable to request smuggling).
