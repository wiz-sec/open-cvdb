summary: |
  A publicly exposed GitHub token in CodeQL workflow artifacts could allow attackers to execute malicious code
  in repositories using CodeQL, potentially leading to source code exfiltration, secrets compromise, and supply
  chain attacks. The vulnerability stemmed from a debug artifact containing environment variables, which could be
  downloaded and exploited within a 1-2 second window.
manualRemediation: |
  Update to CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected branch or tag creations in CodeQL-related repositories. Scan workflow artifacts for exposed secrets. Review CodeQL workflow configurations for unsafe tag references.
