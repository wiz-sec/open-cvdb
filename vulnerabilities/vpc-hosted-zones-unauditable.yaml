summary: |
  For 6 years, it was not possible to see what hosted zones an attacker
  may have created in an account. This issue could be viewed as a business decision
  that adding the ability to viewing this data was not worthwhile, but the delay
  is significant and would allow someone that had compromised an environment to
  maintain a backdoor.
