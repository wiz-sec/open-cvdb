summary: |
  Threat actors in possession of IAM active credentials that had the power to
  update S3 bucket policies could have bypassed GuardDuty’s S3 detections and
  silently updated permissions for S3 resources, resulting in a bucket configuration
  that allowed anonymous data access. This gap in GuardDuty’s alert coverage
  occurred only when S3’s Block Public Access was not enabled on the account
  or the bucket, and when KMS-based server-side bucket encryption was not in
  use. In order to trigger on opening public access, GuardDuty needs to invoke
  two API calls: GetBucketPublicAccessBlock and GetBucketPolicyStatus. Blocking
  these specific API calls essentially blocked GuardDuty’s ability to trigger
  the alerts. Following disclosure, AWS added GD alerts on the creation of any
  policy that both allows data access but seeks to deny access to configuration information.
