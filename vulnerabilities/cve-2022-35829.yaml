summary: |
  Service Fabric Explorer (SFX) is a tool for inspecting and managing Azure Service Fabric clusters.
  An attacker with existing access to a "Deployer" type user with CreateComposeDeployment permissions
  in a given cluster could create a malicious application with a specially-crafted name. This would
  lead to client-side template injection (CSTI) and storing a malicious XSS payload in a dashboard
  shared between users of the same cluster. If a victim user with administrative permissions logged
  into the compromised SFX dashboard and clicked on the aforementioned payload, the attacker could
  hijack their permissions to perform a cluster node reset, erasing all customized settings including
  passwords and security configurations. This would allow the attacker to create new passwords and
  thereby gain full administrator access of the cluster.
manualRemediation: |
