summary: |
  The AppFlow WooCommerce connector allowed specification of a full URL.
  The connector included details of response content when the URL
  offered an unexpected response. This means you could make arbitrary
  GET requests to any URL from the WooCommerce connector, and view the 
  response content. The response in the error was truncated to 500 characters.
