summary: |
  The AWS Client VPN service was found to be affected by two
  vulnerabilities which could potentially allow malicious actors with access to
  a user’s device to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges,
  including escalating to root access. Both vulnerabilities stem from buffer
  overflow issues, a common programming error that can be exploited to overwrite
  memory and gain unauthorized control over a system. The impact of these
  vulnerabilities is severe, as successful exploitation could lead to complete
  compromise of an affected device. Attackers could gain access to sensitive
  data, install malware, or disrupt system operations. Given the widespread use
  of AWS Client VPN for secure remote access, the potential for widespread
  exploitation is a significant concern. AWS has acted swiftly to address these
  vulnerabilities, releasing updated versions of the Client VPN software for all
  supported platforms. However, the onus is on users to promptly apply these
  updates to mitigate the risk.
manualRemediation: |
  Customers using AWS Client VPN should upgrade to version
  3.11.1 or higher for Windows, 3.9.2 or higher for MacOS, and 3.12.1 or higher
  for Linux.
