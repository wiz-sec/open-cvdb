summary: |
  A critical vulnerability in GitHub's actions/runner-images repository allowed arbitrary code execution on self-hosted runners, potentially enabling modification of GitHub's runner base images. The flaw stemmed from misconfigured self-hosted runners on a public repository with default workflow approval settings. The researcher gained persistence, accessed secrets, and could have inserted malicious code into GitHub's runner images used by customers.
manualRemediation: |
  Change repository settings to "Require approval for all outside collaborators" for any public repository using self-hosted runners. Apply defense-in-depth measures to self-hosted runners.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected changes to workflow files, especially the runs-on field. Review logs for signs of unauthorized access or unusual activity on self-hosted runners. Implement strict approval processes for workflows from fork pull requests.
