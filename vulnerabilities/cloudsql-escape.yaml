summary: |
  In GCP's case, they introduced a modification to the Cloud SQL's PostgreSQL engine allowing the role assigned to the
  tenant (cloudsqlsuperuser) to arbitrarily change the ownership of a table to any user
  or role in the database. Thus, an attacker could (1) create a new table, (2) create an
  index function with a malicious payload, and (3) change the table owner to GCP’s superuser
  role (cloudsqladmin). Next, by initiating an ANALYZE command, the malicious function is
  executed with GCP’s superuser high privileges. Then, an attacker could gain local privilege
  escalation to root using a symlink attack, and finally, having gained CAP_NET_ADMIN and
  CAP_NET_RAW capabilities, escape their container via TCP injection of a fake configuration
  response from the metadata service containing an attacker-controlled SSH key (this is only
  possible due to the fact that communication with GCP's metadata service is unencrypted and unsigned).
  A similar bug existed in Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and was part of ExtraReplica's vulnerability chain.
