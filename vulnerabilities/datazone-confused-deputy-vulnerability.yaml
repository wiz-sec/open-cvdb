summary: |
  A vulnerability in Amazon DataZone allowed potential attackers to assume roles in AWS accounts by exploiting a confused deputy problem. This could have granted unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by DataZone or other AWS services accessible by the IAM role trusting DataZone. The issue has been resolved, with no customers reportedly impacted.
manualRemediation: |
  Ensure AWS accounts associated with a domain are properly vetted, review and audit IAM roles and their trust relationships, and enforce least privilege access principles.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected AssumeRole events from datazone.amazonaws.com in CloudTrail logs, especially for roles not explicitly associated with your DataZone environments.
