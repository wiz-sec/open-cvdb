summary: |
  Binary Security found two vulnerabilities in the legacy Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST API.
  The first vulnerability allowed an attacker with Reader access to an Azure Function, acting from
  a Windows host, to get an admin token that could be exchanged for a master key granting access
  to all operations in Kudu (the Functions deployment service). This would allow them to tamper
  with the function by deploying malicious code to it. The other vulnerability allowed an attacker
  with Reader access to an Azure App Service to read all process environment variables, including
  Key Vault references. For Azure Functions, this would result in complete compromise of the app.
