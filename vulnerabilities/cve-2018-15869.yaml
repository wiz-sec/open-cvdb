summary: |
  Attackers had put malicious AMIs in the marketplace to abuse the CLI''s
  way of selecting what AMI to use. Although the concept of planting  malicious
  AMIs had existed for a while (ex. in the 2009 presentation "Clobbering the clouds"
  by Nicholas Arvanitis, Marco Slaviero, and Haroon Meer) it had not been used specifically
  to target this issue with the CLI.
manualRemediation: |
  Update CLI and other tools that create EC2s
