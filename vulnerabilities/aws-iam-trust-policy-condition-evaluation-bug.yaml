summary: |
  Tag variable names affected whether trust policy conditions were evaluated correctly.
  If the request tag referenced a principal tag called MemberRole in the JWT token, and 
  the IAM role referenced a resource tag with the same variable name, the condition was
  always evaluated as true, regardless of whether the tag's values actually matched. Only
  role trust policies that used a variable substitution for both the request tag and the
  resource tag in the policy statement resulted in the policy evaluating incorrectly. The 
  issue impacted statements within IAM boundary policies and SCP policies that contained 
  the same pattern of STS role assumption with tag-based conditions.
