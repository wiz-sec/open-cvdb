summary: |
  Customers can configure Chronicle to ingest data from customer-owned 
  Cloud Storage buckets using an ingestion feed. Chronicle previously used a shared
  service account for all customers for granting permission to the bucket.
  Therefore, one customer's Chronicle instance could be configured to ingest data 
  from another customer's Cloud Storage bucket. However, this required knowledge 
  of the bucket URI.
