summary: |
  A vulnerability in AWS CloudWatch dashboard sharing allowed viewers to access EC2 instance tags and potentially invoke Lambda functions in the source account. The issue stemmed from a logic bug in the AWS Console combined with a "fail open" condition in Amazon Cognito. AWS has since patched the vulnerability.
manualRemediation: |
  Review and limit use of shared dashboards. Restrict IAM permissions for dashboard sharing. Scope additional IAM permissions narrowly when using custom dashboard features.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected EC2:DescribeTags API calls. Review Cognito Identity Pool configurations, especially the AllowClassicFlow setting.
