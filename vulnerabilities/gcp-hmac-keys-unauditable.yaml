summary: |
  GCP administrators face challenges in managing HMAC keys within their organizations, 
  lacking visibility into which user accounts have generated these keys and whether they are 
  actively being used to access storage objects. Additionally, there's a lack of functionality 
  to revoke keys associated with other users, restricting their ability to enforce security 
  policies effectively. Similarly, GCP incident response teams rely on Cloud Logging to monitor
  Cloud Storage object access, but they lack specific indicators to determine if HMAC keys are
  being utilized in these access attempts.
manualRemediation: |
  No full remediation is possible at this time. While various containment actions, such as suspending
  or deleting compromised user accounts, may initially seem effective by rejecting previously created
  Sigv4 signed headers, reactivating or recreating the same user allows the reuse of credentials
  unless they have expired. Furthermore, removing Cloud IAM Roles can revoke access to affected storage
  resources. However, it's important to note that reassigning roles does not invalidate previously
  created Sigv4 signed headers, allowing them to continue functioning even after the role change.
