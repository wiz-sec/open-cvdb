summary: |
  AWS have released or changed managed IAM policies in unexpected and insecure ways.
  Examples include: CheesepuffsServiceRolePolicy, AWSServiceRoleForThorInternalDevPolicy,
  AWSCodeArtifactReadOnlyAccess.json, AmazonCirrusGammaRoleForInstaller. The worst
  being the ReadOnlyAccess policy having almost all privileges removed and unexpected
  ones added.
