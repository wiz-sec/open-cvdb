summary: |
  A Microsoft employee accidentally published credentials via a git commit to a public repository.
  These credentials granted privileged access to an internal Azure Container Registry (ACR) used by Azure,
  which reportedly held container images utilized by multiple Azure projects, including Azure IoT Edge, Akri,
  and Apollo. The privileged access could have allowed an attacker to download private images as well
  as upload new images and (most importantly) overwrite existing ones. In theory, an attacker could have
  leveraged the latter to implement a supply chain attack against these Azure projects and their users.
  However, it is currently unknown precisely which images this ACR contained or how they were used,
  so the effective impact of this issue remains undetermined.
