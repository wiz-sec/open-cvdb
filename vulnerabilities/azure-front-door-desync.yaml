summary: |
  A client-side desync vulnerability was discovered in Front Door, one of Azure's CDN solutions,
  caused by mishandling of the 'Content-Length' header in HTTP requests. Exploiting this vulnerability
  would most likely require user interaction through social engineering (such as clicking on a malicious
  link), but could allow an attacker to steal session cookies or forge responses to victim requests.
