summary: |
  Azure on-premises data gateway allows data transfer between an on-prem customer network and
  several Azure cloud services, and also enables a connected agent installed locally in an
  on-prem network to perform certain actions remotely. NetSPI discovered a deserialization
  issue in Microsoft Power Platform connectors that lead to RCE on several Azure backend
  servers that processed call backs from on-premises data gateways, effectively allowing
  unauthorized cross-tenant access.
