summary: |
  Asset Key Thief was a Google Cloud 
  privilege escalation vulnerability that enabled 
  principals with the "Cloud Asset Viewer" role (or other roles 
  with the `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources` permission) on the 
  Cloud Asset Inventory API, at the Project, Folder, or Organization level 
  to view and exfiltrate any user-managed Service Account 
  private key under a project within the same Google Cloud environment that 
  had been created or rotated up to a maximum of 12 hours ago. 
  Access to Service Account private keys enable the full assumption 
  of that Service Account's identity and privileges, which would have given 
  attackers with existing access to a Google Cloud environment a persistent and reliable
  method of lateral movement and privilege escalation. Google has since fixed this 
  vulnerability, but affected customers must rotate their keys manually.
manualRemediation: |
  Consider rotating user-managed Service Account keys created prior to 14/03/23. 
  Search for anomalous Service Account activity. 
  Audit principals with access to the "cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources" permission. 
  Search for "google.cloud.asset.v1.AssetService.SearchAllResources" ADMIN_READ data access logs.
