summary: |
  For AWS CodeBuild, when using a custom container image stored in ECR and the 
  project service role for the credentials to pull the image, the default IAM 
  policy attached to the role to allow pulling the container was over-privileged 
  and allowed the CodeBuild container to overwrite its own build image. 
  An attacker with the ability to read the container credentials from the meta-data 
  service or run commands within the container could thereby overwrite the container to gain 
  persistence within the CodeBuild project.
manualRemediation: |
  For any CodeBuild projects created before July 26, 2022, which are using a custom container image, 
  update those project’s IAM policies to match the updated policy. 
  Please refer to the CodeBuild documentation for updating your project’s IAM policies.
