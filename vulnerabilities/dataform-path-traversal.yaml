summary: |
  Dataform could have allowed a malicious customer to gain unauthorized cross-tenant access
  to other customer's code repositories and data. By preparing a maliciously crafted package.json
  file, an attacker could exploit a path traversal vulnerability in the npm package installation
  process, thereby gaining read and write access in other customers' repositories. According to
  Google, there was no evidence of exploitation in the wild.
