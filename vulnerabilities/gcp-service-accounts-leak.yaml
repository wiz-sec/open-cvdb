summary: |
  It was possible to list IAM service accounts of any GCP project, given only its ID, by forging a pageToken for the projects.serviceAccounts.list 
  method of the IAM API. Due to the design of certain services in GCP, this issue could lead to exposure of sensitive information related to a project,
  and could be further used to enumerate unsecured resources in the platform, such as App Engine apps, Container Registry repositories, etc.
