summary: |
  Binary Security discovered and registered two dangling cloudapp.azure.com
  subdomains corresponding to subdomains at visualstudio.com. Had these been
  discovered and registered by an attacker, this would have been equivalent
  to a 1-click vulnerability for Azure DevOps: the attacker could have crafted
  a URL referring to the sign-in API for Azure DevOps Services (app.vssps.visualstudio.com)
  using one of the two subdomains in the "reply_to" field (since subdomains
  of visualstudio.com would be allowed by the API). If clicked on by a target
  Azure DevOps user, this would have sent an authentication token to an
  attacker-controlled server, thereby allowing account takeover.
