summary: |
  CloudFormation allows the use of Lambda-backed resource providers,
  wherein Lambda can be used to write custom provisioning logic to be
  executed during CloudFormation stack operations. The aforementioned
  Lambda functions were executed in an AWS-managed account (thus
  effectively allowing arbitrary code execution in that account),
  and were passed a set of credentials ("platformCredentials") for a
  role in this account that had several EventBridge permissions.
  These were sufficient for an attacker to create new rules in the AWS-managed
  account that leaked credentials belonging to other users of resource
  providers. For example, creating a rule that matched events with
  {"detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"]} exposed records
  of other tenants' API calls, which included copies of credentials
  for roles in other tenants' accounts.
