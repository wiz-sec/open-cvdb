summary: |
  A principal with the permissions glue:GetConnection and ec2:DescribeSubnets
  can retrieve the database password of a connection, since the password is loaded into
  the AWS console website when a connection's edit page is requested. The severity of
  this issue is low since it requires sufficient prior access.
