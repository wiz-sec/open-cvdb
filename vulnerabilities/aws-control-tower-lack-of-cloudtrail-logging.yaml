summary: |
  AWS Control Tower was not properly logging to CloudTrail when API calls
  failed due to a lack of permissions. This could have helped an adversary
  with existing access to a victim AWS environment avoid detection while
  enumerating privileges, since any unsuccessful API calls would not
  generate "access denied" log entries.
