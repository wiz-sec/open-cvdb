summary: |
  A privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Google's Dialogflow cloud platform. When downgrading a user's role from Developer to Reviewer, the permissions were not properly updated, allowing the user to retain Developer-level access. This issue persisted in the Google Cloud Console, where role changes resulted in additive permissions instead of replacements.
manualRemediation: |
  None required
detectionMethods: |
  Administrators can verify user permissions in the Google Cloud Console IAM section to ensure they match the intended access levels set in Dialogflow.
