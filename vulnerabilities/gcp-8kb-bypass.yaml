summary: |
  Cloud Armor has a documented limitation of 8 KB as the maximum size of web
  request that it will inspect. The default behavior of Cloud Armor in this case can allow
  oversized malicious requests to bypass Cloud Armor and directly reach an underlying application.
  Morevoer, Cloud Armor does not warn users of this limitation during policy creation
  or when configuring rules from within the web UI, and can only find a reference to
  the 8 KB limit in the [Cloud Armor documentation](https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs/security-policy-overview).
manualRemediation: |
  A custom rule can be added in Advanced mode - `int(request.headers["content-length"]) >= 8192`,
  with 502, 403, or 404 HTTP response status in return.
