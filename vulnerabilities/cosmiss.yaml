summary: |
  Cosmos DB notebooks lacked an authentication check, meaning that if an attacker
  somehow had prior knowledge of a notebook’s temporary ‘forwardingId’ (a 128bit
  cryptographically random GUID assigned to a short-lived workspace that expires
  after an hour), they could gain full permissions on the notebook, including
  read and write access and the ability to modify the file system of the
  container running the notebook. These permissions would suffice for an
  attacker to obtain remote code execution (RCE) in the notebook container.
  However, this would not allow an attacker to execute notebooks, automatically
  save notebooks in the victim’s (optionally) connected GitHub repository, or
  access data in the Cosmos DB account. Following disclosure, Cosmos DB notebooks
  now require an authorization token in the request header before allowing access.
