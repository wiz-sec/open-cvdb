summary: |
  AWS added an excessive s3:getObject permission to AWSSupportServiceRolePolicy
  IAM policy used by AWS Support teams, and removed it a day later.
manualRemediation: |
  None required, though best practice would be to use KMS-CMK for bucket
  encryption and minimize privileges in resource policies.
