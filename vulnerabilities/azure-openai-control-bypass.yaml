summary: |
  A way to manage Azure OpenAI deployments via the Data Plane was discovered, bypassing key security controls. This allows creation/modification/deletion of deployments without the usual protections of Resource Manager Locks, Azure Policy, and Entra ID authentication.
manualRemediation: |
  Avoid using the Azure AI Developer built-in role. Add the affected OpenAI deployment operations to the NotDataActions section of applicable Role Definitions.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected changes to Azure OpenAI deployments, especially those made via the data plane APIs. Review role assignments and custom roles for overly permissive OpenAI permissions.
