summary: |
  Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions allow deployment of runners and agents using VM images sourced from a GitHub-managed
  repository (github.com/actions/runner-images). This repo was misconfigured to use self-hosted runners insecurely,
  in a way that could have allowed a malicious external contributor (i.e., anyone who had previously had at least one PR
  approved and merged in the repo) to achieve code execution on runners in the repo. This in turn could have theoretically
  allowed an attacker to modify the source code of the images, and thereby conduct a supply chain attack against Pipelines
  and Actions customers.
