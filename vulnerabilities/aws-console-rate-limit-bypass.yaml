summary: |
  AWS applies a rate limit to authentication requests made to the AWS Console
  in an effort to prevent brute-force and credential stuffing attacks. However,
  a weakness was discovered in the AWS Console authentication flow that allowed
  a partial bypass of this rate limit by pausing for 5 seconds every 30 attempts.
  This would enable an attacker to continuously attempt more than 280 passwords
  per minute (4.6 per second) against IAM users, which could have resulted in
  account compromise of users without MFA enabled.
