summary: |
  AWS Directory Service didn't check the iam:PassRole permissions when using the
  EnableRoleAccess action. This could have been used for privilege escalation by an
  authenticated user with sufficient permissions (ds:EnableRoleAccess), if the
  role had a trust policy that allowed use by Directory Service.
manualRemediation: |
  None required

  Roles trusting Directory Service being assumed by unexpected users.
