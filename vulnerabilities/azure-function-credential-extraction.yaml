summary: |
  A vulnerability in Azure Function Apps allowed extraction of Managed Identity credentials from the encrypted startup context of Linux containers. This gave attackers with container access the ability to persist as the Managed Identity, breaking the intended security model. Microsoft has since patched the issue by encrypting the sensitive payload.
manualRemediation: |
  None required. Microsoft has addressed the issue on their end.
detectionMethods: |
  Monitor for unexpected authentication attempts using Managed Identity certificates, especially from IP addresses not associated with the Function App.
