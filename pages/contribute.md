# How to contribute?

This website reflects the current state of data stored in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wiz-sec/open-cvdb). To contribute a new issue or suggest an edit to an existing one, please add a commit and our maintainers will review it for merging within a few days (but usually sooner).

Please make sure that your contributions match our [criteria](http://cloudvulndb.org/about) for inclusion, and follow these guidelines:
1.  Use the [CVDB YAML](https://github.com/wiz-sec/open-cvdb/blob/main/pages/sample.yaml) format. 
2.	Include public references (as URLs).
3.	Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue.
4.	Give the issue a descriptive and non-generic title.
5.	Give proper credit to the researchers involved in the discovery.
6.	Use respectful language (avoid disparaging CSPs, vendors or researchers).

Please note that this database only includes information about publicly known issues and is not an appropriate venue for initial disclosure. Therefore, please refrain from using this platform to publish non-public information, and reach out to the relevant CSP or vendor instead.
